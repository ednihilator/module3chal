## Description

I contributed to this project to work within the parameters set by the instructors with given code, while adding more code in javascript. Hopefully this solves any issues with passwords not being secure enough. I learned that a button can call a function in multiple ways, and I learned how a variable gets referenced in another file.


## Installation

Open the index.html file and a new window should pop up

## Usage
  
  ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

Enter how many characters you want your password to be, 8-24 characters. Confirm yes or no for special characters, numbers, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters.

## Credits

Someone from the course made most of the code in the .html, .css, and .js files.
